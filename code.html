    Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark
     about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.[1][2] The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.[3][4]
Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance 
of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet
 (61 m) high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose
  much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, 
  iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga architecture.[
</p> 
<p>
    The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of controversy.[7] Theories
     range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim 
     armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.[1][7] This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in European sailor accounts as 
     early as 1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black.[6][8] Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri
      was called the "White Pagoda". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal.[9][10] The temple 
      that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO
       world heritage site in 1984,[1][2] it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga
        Mela around the month of February.[6]

<h1><div align="left"><u>Taj Mahal</u></h1></div>

<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632
     by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex,
     which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 
    10 years.</p>
  <p>  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be 
    around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project 
    employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad 
    Lahauri.</p>
  <p> The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one 
    of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal archite
    cture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a win
    ner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative. </p>

<p>Qutub Minar is a minaret or a victory tower located in Qutub complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi's Mehrauli area.
     With the height of 72.5 metres (238 ft), Qutub Minar is the second tallest monument of Delhi. Its construction was started in 1192
      by Qutb Ud-Din-Aibak, founder of Delhi Sultanate after he defeated the last Hindu Ruler of Delhi. He constructed the basement, 
      after which the construction was taken over by his son-in-law and successor Iltutmish who constructed three additional stories. 
      The fourth and fifth storeys were built by Firoz Shah Tuglak.</p>

<h1><div align="left"><u>Red Fort</u></div></h1>
<img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/Delhi_Red_fort_20190312151147.jpg" alt="Red Fort" style="width:420px;height:281px;">
<p>The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the old Delhi area. Shah Jahan constructed it in the year 1639 as a result of a 
    capital shift from Agra to Delhi. Used as the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty, this imposing piece of 
    architecture derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their
     households, it was the ceremonial and political centre of the Mughal state and the setting for events critically impacting 
     the region. Today, this monument is home to several museums that have an assortment of precious artefacts on display. Every year, 
     the Indian Prime Minister unfurls the national flag here on the Independence Day.

    Formerly known as Quila-e-Mubarak or the Blessed Fort, the Red Fort lies along the banks of the river Yamuna, 
    whose waters fed the moats surrounding the fort. It was a part of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, popularly known 
    today as 'Old Delhi'. The entire fort complex is said to represent the architectural creativity and brilliance of Mughal 
    architecture. With so much history and heritage associated with it, the Red Fort is one of the most popular monuments in 
    India and a major tourist attraction in Delhi. It became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2007. The Archaeological Survey 
     India is at present responsible for the security and preservation of this magnificent monument.</p>

<h1><div align="left"><u>Hampi,Karnataka</u></div></h1>
<img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/HAMPI.jpg" alt="Red Fort" style="width:420px;height:281px;">
<p>Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of 
    Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling 
    street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight.
     Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.
</p>
<p>Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that 
    time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures
     spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders
      of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the
       geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially
        the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and 
        military barracks and stables here. Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to
         restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives 
         an authentic feel to the ruins.</p>
